Abstract

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of transaction-level records. Each row represents a customer purchase capturing demographic details, product information, purchase amount, ratings, seasons, and shipping preferences. From the data, we can see that customers vary widely in age, but most purchases are concentrated among adults between 25 and 45—an age group that tends to spend more on clothing, footwear, and accessories. Customer reviews are mostly positive, indicating overall satisfaction with the products and shopping experience. A large portion of customers also opt into subscription services, showing a preference for loyalty benefits and streamlined shopping. Shipping choices reveal that many customers prefer free or 2-day shipping, indicating that delivery speed and cost strongly influence purchasing decisions. Payment is diversified across credit cards, PayPal, and digital options, confirming the shift toward cashless shopping. Overall, the dataset tells a story of a dynamic retail environment where customer preferences are shaped by demographics, seasonality, delivery convenience, and product categories. These insights can help businesses optimize inventory, refine marketing strategies, and improve customer experience.
